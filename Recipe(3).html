    Instructions:
    
<li>Prepare the Cookie Dough:</li>
<li>1. Preheat your oven to 175°C and line baking sheets with baking paper.</li>
<li>2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
3. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then add the vanilla extract and almond extract (if using). Mix well.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix.

**2. Shape and Bake the Cookies:**

1. Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, portion the dough into approximately 2-inch balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving enough space between each cookie.
2. Gently press down on each ball of dough to flatten it slightly.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers should still be soft.
4. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

**3. Prepare the Frosting:**

1. In a mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy.
2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.
3. Stir in the vanilla extract.
4. Add milk or heavy cream, one tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. The frosting should be smooth and spreadable but not too thin.
5. If using food coloring, divide the frosting into separate bowls and tint each bowl with your desired colors.

**4. Frost and Decorate:**

1. Once the cookies are completely cool, spread a generous dollop of frosting onto each cookie using a knife or an offset spatula.
2. Decorate the frosted cookies with sprinkles or other decorations of your choice while the frosting is still soft.

**5. Serve and Enjoy:**

Allow the frosting to set before serving or storing the cookies. Once the frosting has hardened, you can stack the cookies between layers of parchment paper in an airtight container. Enjoy your homemade Lofthouse Sugar Cookies!

Feel free to get creative with your frosting colors and decorations to make these cookies uniquely your own. Happy baking!
